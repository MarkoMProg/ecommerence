Prediction Competition Rules
Group Stage Matches

Maximum 7 points per match

Correctly predicted match outcome (Win/Draw) gives 3 points
Example:
Germany plays Portugal and Germany wins 4–0.
You predicted Germany would win 2–1 → you get 3 points (correct outcome type).

Correctly predicted number of goals gives 2 points per team (max 4 points total).

Example:
Germany plays Portugal and Portugal wins 3–0.

You predicted Portugal would win 1–0
Points earned: 3 + 2 = 5 points
(Portugal wins, and Germany scored 0 goals as you predicted)

You predicted Portugal would win 3–0
Points earned: 3 + 2 + 2 = 7 points
(You predicted goals scored by both teams correctly)
